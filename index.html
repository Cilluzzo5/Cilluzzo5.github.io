								<strong>Hi! I'm <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicola-cilli-a3310118a/">Nicola Cilli</a></strong>, a Data Scientist and Machine Learning Engineer passionate about business solutions, 
								problem-solving, and the intellectual challenges that our field presents.
							</p>
							<p>
								I graduated in Computer Science from the University of Milan-Bicocca. I completed my <a href="https://bestr.it/badge/show/677/">Bachelor's degree</a> in 2020, 
								alongside an exciting project in the automotive industry, which resulted in a publication in the prestigious 
								<a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-86841-3_12">Springer journal</a>. Following that, I started my Master's degree while working as a Data Science 
								Consultant for a renowned Milan-based company. I completed my <a href="https://bestr.it/badge/show/923">Master's degree</a> on time in 2022 with a thesis on an ensemble model 
								for fraud detection.
							</p>
							<p>
								My career has always been driven by a strong sense of initiative, allowing me to take on increasing levels of responsibility. 
								Specifically, I've always aimed to become a Data Scientist with a focus on putting models into production! Real-time models, 
								batch processing, synchronous and asynchronous communication, database synchronization, event-driven systems—everything that 
								surrounds a model excites me as much as building the model itself.
							</p>
							<p>
								Today, I am a proud technical and project leader, managing a portfolio of clients while eager to explore the more strategic aspects of my work. 
								This side involves communication and processes that culminate in an AI project. To nurture this curiosity, I also study finance in my free time. 
								I am a huge fan of my career because it allows me to do something I love: help others. And helping others, scientifically in this case, fills my days 
								with purpose and brings new, exciting challenges.
